## About
{{Project Terpsichore}} is an early attempt at creating an Android application which allows users to play a song guessing game. Each round a random song is played {(for short period perhaps)} and the user will have {{time}} seconds to guess the name of the song and/or artist. If they are successful they get {{a point | number of points determined by: DC and time remaining (and frequency of appearance?)}}. This application interconnects with {{music provider}} API {{or set thereof}} to retreive the song's respective data.

## Development
First major development checkpoint is to create a working single-player application, then look into options considering multiplayer in test  environments.
